I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr.-Ing. JÃ¶rg Ott for allowing me to write this thesis at his chair. Furthermore, I am grateful to my advisor Trinh Viet Doan, for motivating me and for lending me his expertise and knowledge. I would also like to acknowledge Prof. Hiroaki Nishi from the Keio University at the Department of System Design Engineering guiding me during my stay in Japan.
